# Medium_Notebooks
This repository contains jupyter notebooks for medium articles I've written. These notebooks are often only containing code for smaller use cases. 

# Imbalance_Regression_Target
This notebook analyzes data imbalance on the target class for a regression in machine learning. The boston housing data set from scikit-learn is used (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html).

## Tech Stack
Python, jupyter notebook, scikit-learn, matplotlib, scipy.

# KMeans_Inertia_Tutorial
In this notebook I demonstrate a strategy for comparing unsupervised machine learning model results, when no ground truth data is given.

## Tech Stack
Python, jupyter notebook, scikit-learn, matplotlib.

# Build_ETL_Pipeline
In this small project, I showcase how to create a ETL pipeline by collecting data from different sources and creating a final dataset. 

## Tech Stack
Python, jupyter notebook, BeatifulSoup, requests.
